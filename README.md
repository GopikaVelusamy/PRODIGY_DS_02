Perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis(EDA) on a dataset of your choice, such as the Titanic dataset from kaggle. Explore the relationships betwwen variables and indentify the patterns and trends in the data.

Titanic Dataset Analysis

#Overview

This repository contains an exploratory data analysis of the Titanic dataset sourced from Kaggle. The analysis aims to uncover insights into the factors that influenced survival rates during the tragic sinking of the Titanic. This project utilizes Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to clean data, analyze trends, and visualize relationships between different variables.

#Prerequisites

To visualize the dataset, you'll need:

1.Python installed on your machine

2.Necessary libraries: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, numpy

#Getting Started

1.Data Preparation

Ensure you have the relevant data in an Excel file located in the same directory as your script.

2.Running the Script

Open a Python environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, Python script).

Copy and paste the provided code into your Python environment.

3.Executing the Visualization

Run the script and the code will load the data, process it.

#Key Insights

1.Survival Rates by Gender: The analysis indicates that females had a significantly higher survival rate compared to males.

2.Impact of Passenger Class on Survival: Higher-class passengers (Class 1) had better survival rates.

3.Age and Survival: Younger passengers tended to survive more than older passengers.
